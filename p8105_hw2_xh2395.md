## Problem 1

**Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:**

``` r
Mr_Trash_data = 
  read_excel(path = "./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls)))
```

**Read and clean precipitation data for 2018**

``` r
preci2018_data = 
  read_excel(path = "./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(total) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018)
```

**Read and clean precipitation data for 2017**

``` r
preci2017_data = 
  read_excel(path = "./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "2017 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(total) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017)
```

**Combine precipitation datasets**

``` r
com_data = full_join(preci2017_data, preci2018_data, by = NULL) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

    ## Joining, by = c("month", "total", "year")

In dataset “Mr\_Trash\_data”, the number of observations is 285, and the
number of variables is 14. Key variables include “dumpster” and
“sports\_balls”.

In dataset “preci2018\_data”, the number of observations is 7, and the
number of variables is 3. Key variables include “year”, “month” and
“total”.

In dataset “preci2017\_data”, the number of observations is 12, and the
number of variables is 3. Key variables include “year”, “month” and
“total”.

In dataset “com\_data”, the number of observations is 19, and the number
of variables is 3. Key variables include “year”, “month” and “total”.

The total precipitation in 2018 is 23.5 inches.

The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 is 8.
